                        <p class="paragraph abstract">
                            The contemporary Russian art community is under the constant watchful eyes of conservative
                            activist groups and the government, and self-censorship is the norm even though the
                            government claims that it does not interfere in this domain. What happened? Pussy Riot’s
                            2012 performance and trial were a turning point in the development of the Russian art world
                            and catalyzed the implementation of new mechanisms of control. The question at the heart of
                            this study is: how has the Russian government’s policy, from 2012 onwards, influenced
                            artistic life in Russia and contributed to artists’ perceived need to self-censor their
                            work? To unpack what changed and why, this thesis examines the changes in the relationship
                            between the Russian government and artists as well as the methods used by the state to exert
                            influence over artists, and finds linkages between contemporary censorship policy and
                            censorship in Stalin’s USSR. In addition, the thesis draws from the author’s personal
                            experiences with self-censorship as well as those of other Russian artists in order to
                            capture this phenomenon’s mechanisms at both a macro and micro level.

                            When we think of censorship, we typically imagine a register of concrete rules and
                            prohibitions, but in the contemporary world, where access to increasingly abundant sources
                            of information is similarly ever growing, there are few countries that can afford such
                            traditional mass censorship campaigns. Usually, these are very closed states where there is
                            a high degree of control over different forms of self-expression. Contemporary authoritarian
                            regimes have abandoned this scheme for the most part and, instead, seek to introduce systems
                            of pressure whereby society begins to censor itself. This type of censorship is applied
                            selectively, is less expensive, maintains a semblance of freedom, and the public typically
                            scrutinizes the ‘propriety’ of art instead of the state.

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            In September 2016, a scandal erupted in the Russian art world. The American photographer
                            Jock Sturges aroused indignation among conservatives in Russian society, because there were
                            rumors that photographs of naked children were on display <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            group of well-organized activists calling themselves the ‘Officers of Russia’ blocked access
                            to the gallery at which the artist’s exhibition was held <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            important not because people assembled for their collective aversion to photos of nude
                            underage models (even though this later proved to be false), but because a group of people
                            were able to get a gallery to voluntarily close an exhibition in response to claims that it
                            was eroding society’s morality <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            because of pressure by the ‘Officers of Russia’, not because the work on display somehow
                            violated any laws as this had been reviewed prior to its opening <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

This shows that any organization with sufficient human and financial resources, and
                            whose mission statement is to defend Russian-Orthodoxy or patriotism, can censor artistic
                            life in the country without any contestation by the government.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            This case is illustrative of what I would like to talk about in my thesis, namely how the
                            Russian government’s policies have normalized aggression against artists and created an
                            atmosphere of self-censorship in the Russian art world. While there is no official
                            censorship policy with respect to art in the country, the Russian government has sought to
                            exert control over the art community in more indirect ways. As will be made evident over the
                            course of this thesis, the government’s actions indicate that it views artists who are
                            critical of the socio-economic conditions of the country, its institutions, history, or
                            leadership as its political opponents. It has been officially declared that the art
                            community and society should filter undesirable elements out independently, without
                            interference from the government <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            only been (financially) supporting art of a nature and content that is in tune with its own
                            ideals <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            mechanism has effectively amounted to a coercive form of self-censorship imposed upon the
                            producers of any content that is perceived to conflict with conservative, traditional,
                            religious, or patriotic values. For these reasons, Russia serves as a compelling case to
                            examine contemporary types of censorship and how self-censorship takes root in society.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            In the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), authorities defined a rigid censorship
                            policy and warned that it was forbidden to go beyond what was stipulated. The functional act
                            of censoring content was entrusted to special state institutions. Artists and writers
                            usually knew how to behave and could make judgments as to how far they were willing to go in
                            their work. In contrast, an important aspect of contemporary repression of art and artists
                            in Russia is its inconsistency and selectivity. Opponents of the regime are still more or
                            less free in their statements and media remain relatively independent, too. However,
                            certain laws are formulated in such a way that it is unclear what is forbidden and what is not.
                            For one and the same activity, some people are punished while others are not. This has
                            created a gray zone of uncertainty around controversial subjects, which has had a far larger
                            scope as a discursive deterrent than a direct prohibition of specific subject matter.
                            Everything that is inside or even approaching this gray zone could be perceived as
                            filterable material. Fearing the consequences of violating unclear rules, self-censorship
                            sets in. Another noteworthy component of contemporary censorship in Russia is that pro-government and pro-Church
                            organizations have assumed the role of censors. These organizations, emboldened and legitimated by loosely-formulated laws
                            that limit expression, take it upon themselves to decide what is right and wrong under
                            the aegis of the defending morality in society.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            It is important to research what is happening in Russia to understand how new forms of
                            control are emerging, because, like in Russia, much of Western society has recently seen a
                            surge in the kind of conservatism, fanatical patriotism, and political polarization that
                            gave birth to contemporary Russian censorship. The loss of socially-critical art closes one
                            of the engines of self-criticism in society, furthering the creation of an ideological
                            echo-chamber. As the space for the free expression of ideas narrows, even the most innocuous
                            subjects become politicized and the degree of societal aggression grows. Furthermore,
                            self-censorship in fear of reprisals erodes the freedom of expression in society, and
                            suppression of criticism or debate
                            undermines a fundamental (and often constitutional) agreement between the citizens of the
                            country and their government on which the idea of democracy relies. In a democracy, what is
                            the government if not an extension of the will of its people? Yet, in the absence of any
                            official censorship, the illusion of a fully democratic society is sustained.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            As a Russian artist, the state of the Russian art world affects me one way or another.
                            Whether I return to Russia or stay in Europe changes little about the possibility of my work
                            as an artist becoming a problem for my family. In addition to this, the events taking place
                            in my home country have an effect on my relationship to the themes I want to work with. I
                            constantly ask myself if I would have written this thesis or made a project about
                            censorship if still lived in Russia. Writing this thesis has been a way of making the
                            phenomenon of self-censorship more understandable for myself, both at a personal level and as an
                            artist, allowing me to recognize it in myself, cope with it, and understand how it
                            influences my work. Furthermore, it made it possible for me to situate a long chain of
                            incidents within a broader current of developments that have had deep and lasting
                            ramifications for the art world of my home country.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            Aggression against artists in Russia has gradually intensified over the past years, but
                            because each individual amplification was relatively small it was not until much later that
                            it became apparent that circumstances had changed. Behavior that would have seemed impossible less than
                            a decade ago has been normalized. Hence, one of the aims of this thesis is to provide a
                            reference point so that the gravity of the contemporary context is made evident. To
                            adequately reflect on how contemporary censorship in Russia operates and what its effects
                            have been, this thesis seeks to answer the following research question: how has the Russian
                            government’s policy, from 2012 onwards, influenced artistic life in Russia and contributed
                            to artists’ perceived need to self-censor their work? In order to research how
                            self-censorship has taken root in the present context, this thesis looks at various aspects
                            underlying this phenomenon and draws parallels between historical and contemporary events.
                            Although the main time period under analysis of 2012 to 2017 is relatively short, there have
                            been an abundance of cases and precedents set on how artists are to conduct themselves.
                            Building upon the understanding gained about the roots and mechanisms of self-censorship
                            within the Russian art society, the thesis also unpacks how self-censorship is elicited at
                            the individual level on the basis of personal experiences and insights from other Russian
                            artists.

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            The first chapter provides a foundation for the central concepts of this thesis: censorship
                            and self-censorship. Drawing from academic literature and other secondary sources, it

                            Next, the second chapter of the thesis provides a brief historical review of Russian visual art
                            from 1900 to 1954 based on secondary literature on this time period. Direct prohibitions and
                            repression after the 1930s led to the institutionalization of the main artistic direction
                            during Stalin's reign: socialist realism. It served as a medium for the spread of
                            propaganda. This section focuses on how the censorship of art worked as well as how it
                            affected the development of visual art at the time, and it serves as a constant anchor for
                            the relevance of policies and events in contemporary Russia.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            Following this, the third chapter examines the Pussy Riot scandal of 2012, the political
                            atmosphere at the time, the adaptation of a law on the protection of the religious
                            community’s feelings that legitimized much of the aggression against artists since 2012,
                            and how all these events eventually led to the emergence of the kind of pressure groups
                            that, today, are highly influential agents in the realm of censorship in Russia. This will
                            rely on secondary literature on the Pussy Riot case, accounts from members of the group, as
                            well as numerous Russian news reports on these events.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph introduction">
                            Subsequently, the thesis’s fourth chapter explores important cases that took place between
                            2012 and 2017 in which pro-government and pro-Church pressure groups were able shut down
                            exhibitions, plays, and movies in Russia. It also looks at a variety of important events, public statements,
                            and precedents that shed light on the contemporary relationship between artists and the state.
                            The aim of this is to show how, over time, this entrenched
                            the understanding among artists that touching upon certain subjects in their work will evoke
                            hostile reactions from society, thereby creating a perceived necessity to self-censor one’s
                            work.
                            To do so, this section draws on the personal accounts of various artists, statements
                            from Russian policy-makers, news reports, as well as secondary literature on censorship in
                            the art world.

                            as well as the influence of self-censorship on artists at an individual level. This
                            phenomenon is more than a defense mechanism against chastisement by the government or
                            society; underlying the decision to censor your thoughts and work as an artist is a complex
                            and often confusing confluence of motivations. Included are also insights on the subject
                            from Russian artists who also live and work in Russia at the moment.

                            Before proceeding to the body of the thesis, it is worth discussing the basic concepts of
                            censorship and self-censorship that are at the heart of this research and elaborate how
                            these are understood in the context of this thesis. Historically, in countries such as the USSR,
                            censorship operated as a bureaucratic system of rule enforcement, which forbade the
                            publication of specific books or topics and even maintained lists of specific phrases that
                            were prohibited to use <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            In today’s world, this ‘traditional’ approach is not feasible or practical due developments
                            such as the Internet, the access to which has radically expanded the scope of information
                            and content to be policed and monitored <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            stifle undesirable material and knowledge within this new paradigm, censorship strategies

                            two eras of censorship as follows: “old-school totalitarians were do-it-yourselfers; modern
                            authoritarians like to outsource and, where possible, use market forces to enhance
                            censorship capacity” <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            access to information and its exchange, the heavy-handedness of old model of censorship

                            of news media as “a set of editorial actions ranging from omission, dilution, distortion,
                            and change of emphasis to choice of rhetorical devices by journalists, their organizations,
                            and even the entire media community in anticipation of currying reward and avoiding

                            these very same principles can be identified in and transposed onto the functioning of the
                            Russian art sphere. Replacing the terms ‘journalists’ by ‘artists’ and
                            ‘media community’ by ‘art community’ produces an operational description of self-censorship that largely
                            captures how it functions in this thesis’s area of study.

                            for self-censorship, adding that fear can be further subdivided in fears of various
                            outcomes. Another important dimension is context, as the choice (or the lack thereof) to
                            self-censor is often a matter of “what can be shown where” <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            censorship often tends to be interpreted relatively unambiguously, self-censorship is characterized as
                            “a complex picture of multiple considerations, contextual factors, and decisions often made
                            behind the scenes” <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            “self-censorship is the interiorized fear of government intervention,” whereas in the latter
                            financial security is often the overriding factor, because “as public support shrinks, art
                            institutions are dependent, for their very existence, on the whims of donors” <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            the Russian art world relatively well. However, its scope is limited to the interactions between
                            the art community and the government. In Russia, activist organization that claim to act on behalf of society also
                            play an important role in driving self-censorship in the art community. Groys’s <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            descriptions are useful as well but are similarly incomplete if used as operational
                            definitions. For this reason, elements of all these descriptions were synthesized to try to
                            approximate a more fitting portrayal of the phenomenon. Self-censorship is taken to comprise
                            the actions that individuals, organizations, or a community take to curb or somehow
                            compromise expression in response to an internalized fear of potential punishment, abuse, or
                            financial loss; and in order to earn the approval of their peers, the public, or
                            authorities.

                            To create a self-censored society, governments have two important tools at their disposal:
                            the selective punishment of undesirable agents in society on the basis of opaque rules to
                            provoke uncertainty, and the use of financial dependence and incentives <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            Selectively rather than uniformly applying censorship is when for one and the same
                            offense, certain people or organizations are reprimanded whereas others are not <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            of the rule that legitimates the punishment, its effectiveness as a deterrent is augmented,
                            because this systematic uncertainty causes people to exercise greater caution in their
                            actions than they would otherwise <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            If it is uncertain where the line between appropriate and inappropriate is drawn, people will tend to be extra careful and distance themselves from where this juncture is approximated to be,
                            rather than try to approach it as closely as possible without crossing it. In addition to
                            this, the element of uncertainty offers the government significant flexibility in who it can

                            anticipated by the members of the community subjected to self-censorship, the process that

                            Another method of generating self-censorship is through financial control. In the
                            literature on news media self-censorship, this is known as the “marketization” of news <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            Marketization forces organizations or individuals that heavily rely on government
                            subsidies or grants to acquiesce to the eligibility criteria of these to
                            ensure organizational survival or commercial success. Similarly, even if organizations or
                            artists do not rely on government funding per se, by linking the eligibility of public funds to
                            specific expectations in terms of contents, themes, or style, the government artificially
                            creates and sustains a market for this type of art. By tying funding and, by extension,
                            visibility to strict criteria, certain forms of art become more popular to the exclusion of
                            any material deemed undesirable <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            This chapter is about how the principal style of art in the Soviet Union came to be
                            socialist realism, the primary goal of which was to serve the government’s interests and

                            art and artists were tasked with serving the goals of the state’s propaganda campaign. The
                            art sphere was kept under strict and heavy-handed supervision; any disobedience was severely
                            punished <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            artists and the government was composed and what principles it was based on under this
                            totalitarian regime. This will later also help draw similarities between the government’s
                            relationship toward art in Stalin’s time and in contemporary Russia.

                            Between 1914 and 1922, the Russian avant-garde flourished. This was a time of revolutions and civil war,
                            when there was complete freedom of self-expression, and each artist could, in their own way,
                            contemplate the world around them. The Russian avant-garde was made up of a variety of directions
                            and concepts. Altogether, these shaped the art sphere at the time. Artists created their own schools
                            and groups, wrote manifests, and each tried to emphasize the novelty and uniqueness of their

                            Painting, literature, and music thrived in this period, which is also known as
                            the silver age of Russian culture. In the first years following the 1917 revolution
                            everything was as it had been previously — artists held exhibitions, went from one
                            movement to another, and worked actively. However, following the 1922 civil war, a new
                            and quite involved actor appeared amid them in the art world: the government <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            In present-day Russia, the government’s relationship toward art bears some similarities to
                            the time of socialist realism. The Russian minister of culture has, quite sincerely, stated
                            that if the government hands out money to artists, it has the right to expect that the
                            resultant work will be free of criticism in their direction and be patriotic <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            This chapter focuses on the Pussy Riot trial. This trial and the performance preceding it
                            became turning points in the relationship between Russian artists and authorities. Following
                            the case against the art group, the degree of aggression in society against artists reached
                            all-new highs, which, over time, was normalized by the constant attacks on plays,
                            exhibitions, and performances by pro-Church and pro-government activist groups. The
                            government skillfully capitalized on these events in order to implement a new system of
                            self-censorship in Russia and consolidate support from the conservative segment of Russian
                            society around itself. This chapter will go beyond Pussy Riot’s performance and the trial
                            alone to contextualize these events in the political atmosphere of the country at that time.

                            in front of the city’s central Federal Security Service (FSB) office. The coordinated action
                            was called Dick Captured by the FSB!. It measured 65 by 27 meters and was made in 23 seconds
                            by 9 people. Later, two fire engines tried to wash the graffiti off using hoses. One of the

                            artists from 2012 to 2017. Its aim is to show that the foundations for a self-censored art
                            community are being laid. The government has not focused on creating extensive restrictive
                            measures as is characteristic of traditional censorship policy. Instead, it has relied on
                            more indirect methods of influencing society, as the age of the Internet has made
                            traditional strategies ineffective.

                            the Cold War, and the art world has become a focal point in this battle. To consolidate
                            support around the incumbent regime, authorities and state-run media have been in a constant
                            search of enemies that interfere with the state’s development. As in the USSR, enemies of
                            the state can take on any shape. These could be ecological organizations that rely on

                            Finding evidence of self-censorship is extremely difficult, because it is primarily the
                            internal decision of an artist <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            work, nobody but they can be sure of whether it happened or not. As specified in an earlier
                            chapter of this thesis, self-censorship can be seen as the actions that individuals,
                            organizations, or a community take to curb or somehow compromise expression in response to
                            an internalized fear of potential punishment, abuse, or financial loss; and in order to earn
                            the (tacit) approval of their peers, the public, or authorities. By identifying these
                            components in Russian society, it is possible to indicate elements of self-censorship at
                            work there.

                            In addition, to get an idea of the atmosphere in which self-censorship is cultivated, it is
                            possible to examine novels such as Nineteen Eighty-four by George Orwell or We by Yevgeny
                            Zamyatin. Both were written in the 20th century with less than 30 years separating them.
                            They describe totalitarian cultures and their influence on society. Both show a toxic
                            environment in which the individual is denied freedom and autonomy. In ‘We’, even the names
                            and surnames of people were replaced by letters and numbers. The USSR at the height of
                            Stalin’s repression can also serve as an example of this kind of society. It was a state
                            where people understood that criticism of the existing system was impossible, and any form
                            of contestation of this would be punished. In that world, artists existed to serve the
                            interests of the government. In order to survive, they had to control their
                            ideas and words. In both of these books, the government is fighting perceived internal and external
                            enemies, as in the USSR and in contemporary Russia.
                        </p>

                            The main characters in Orwell’s and Zamyatin’s seminal novels are keenly aware that any
                            manifestation of dissent would be punished and that they need to carefully monitor their
                            actions as well as their thoughts to avoid showing doubt in the governing powers. Constant
                            propaganda and the fear of punishment make people hide their thoughts and ideas from each
                            other too. In such a society, it is not only impossible to criticize the established order
                            but freedom of speech is curbed as well. That is, unless you are ready to pay for it with
                            your life, like Osip Mandelstam did for his poem about Stalin at the height of Stalin’s
                            repressions. He did not publish it; that was impossible, of course. Mandelstam simply read
                            it to his friends. Everybody present in the room at that moment understood what would
                            follow, that there would be punishment, and that, one way or another, somebody would go to
                            the police <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            described by Orwell and Zamyatin, some parallels can still be drawn.
                            In contemporary Russia, artists are relentlessly scrutinized by the media as well as
                            pressure groups, and their actions are overseen by the Ministry of Culture. As a result,
                            they are forced to be cautious in everything they say and do if they value their ability to
                            work, find funding, and wish to avoid being punished for their work.

                            As addressed in the previous chapter, artists came to be seen as political opponents by the Russian
                            government after the 2012 presidential election and the Pussy Riot case. Following these
                            events, artists began to be pressured by the state as well as groups who thought themselves
                            to have the authority to decide what constituted art and what did not. The atmosphere that this
                            created has been very aggressive towards art and is, in certain ways, reminiscent of how
                            officials controlled artists in the USSR. It is aggressive, because it does not allow artists
                            to be critical of the existing regime without fear of being ridiculed, attacked, or banned.
                            However, it is not possible to punish or ban everyone and, at the same time, preserve the
                            appearance of a democratic society in which there is freedom of expression (in life or art).
                            Therefore, the state has sought to retain control over artists while maintaining a façade of
                            freedom. It has done so by encouraging specific ideas and selectively punishing others.
                            Encouragement typically takes the form of financing and awards handed out by state
                            organizations. The ways in which artists are punished are quite diverse: from bullying in
                            the state-run media to direct attacks on artists and their exhibitions or performances,
                            financial audits, criminal prosecutions, or any combination of the aforementioned.

                            By channeling art as a medium for the circulation of patriotic sentiments, the Russian
                            government appears to recognize its influence. At the same time, however, it denies
                            political or socially-critical art the very status of art. While this may seem at odds,
                            according to Freedberg <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            declare that these are not valid as art only further supports the claim that authorities are

                            The rest of this chapter examines several contemporary cases in which artists were persecuted
                            for their statements or work. These cases are
                            emblematic of the wider toxic atmosphere in which Russian artists, filmmakers,

                            Raikin expressed indignation at the frequent attacks on artists, exhibitions, and

                            on what Raikin said, the president’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov replied that ‘censorship,
                            as such, is unacceptable ... Naturally, if the government gives money to some artists, then
                            we have the right to designate a particular topic. This is not censorship; it shouldn’t be

                            and performances. In so doing, Peskov only further underlined that the government wishes to

                            to distance themselves from him as quickly as possible. Andrei Zvyagintsev, who spoke out in
                            support of Raikin, published an open letter in which he asserted that the government should

                            influential in shaping public opinion, as seen with what happened to Konstantin Raikin.
                            Public indignation, once expressed in letters to newspapers, has assumed new shapes. After
                            the Pussy Riot’s trial, some patriotic and religious groups took it upon themselves to
                            express what they claimed was public opinion by way of attacks and threats on artists.
                            Because these groups are not punished, they feel legitimized in their
                            activities and are even further emboldened by statements made by officials on this subject.
                            For example, Vladimir Putin, in a discussion about censorship in Russia, said that

                            This wave of developments since 2012 made it possible for artistic life to be censored by activist groups. These are
                            mainly religious or patriotic groups like as God’s Will and the Officers of Russia,
                            respectively. Artists cannot raise subjects in their work that appear to critically assess the
                            Church, the history of the country, the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine, and
                            many other topics. This raises the following question: if artists refuse to address these topics,
                            is it because they are truly disinterested, or is it because they are afraid of provoking
                            attacks on themselves?

                            Daria Fedorova made a project named The Journey of the Human Microbiome. In Russian
                            churches, it is customary to kiss icons after performing a prayer. The artist wanted to examine what
                            effect this had on a microscopic level, so she took swabs of icons from Moscow churches to be analyzed. Her project
                            is composed of images of the bacteria that remain after people kiss these icons. According
                            to Daria, it was not the intent of her project to paint the Church in a negative light.
                            Nevertheless, she expects that she cannot have it exhibited anywhere, because the Church would
                            see it as an open provocation <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            Thus artists seem to create
                            projects with an awareness of what can be published and what not, which topics can be
                            addressed and exhibited in galleries and which not. This all, of course, takes place in the
                            absence of explicit prohibitions.

                            In the following, I would like to contrast two examples. In the one, an exhibition continued to
                            operate after it had been attacked by conservative activists, while in the other the exhibition was forced to close
                            under pressure. Their differences in financial dependence on the government appear to have been an important differentiator for the
                            outcome of each attack.

                            Center, a human rights organization, in Moscow. Work from the competition Direct Look was
                            shown there, and among the competition’s winners were the photographers Alexander Vasyukovich
                            and Sergei Loiko. They both worked amid the conflict in southeastern
                            Ukraine and photographed Ukrainian soldiers <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            On the exhibition’s
                            opening day someone sprayed the photos from Ukraine with red paint. The
                            ruined images were then replaced by sheets of white paper that said that works
                            devoted to the war in Ukraine had been shown there. The next day, several more attackers appeared demanding the
                            exhibition’s closure, and they removed the sheets that hung in the place of the pictures. At the
                            same time, an inspection of the Sakharov Center was initiated by the public prosecutor’s
                            office for propagandizing Ukrainian nationalism. Even though the name of attacker from the
                            opening day was almost immediately published in the press, police did not investigate him.
                            Despite these events, the Sakharov Center refused to close the exhibition <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            exhibition, members of the patriotic activist group Officers of Russia blocked the entrance to the exhibition and splashed the

                            Nevertheless, the ordeal ended with the exhibition’s closure, because the gallery was unable to

                            first nor in the second case were the aggressors even investigated.

                            it cannot be cut off from funding as a result of such attacks. The Lumiere Brothers
                            Gallery, in contrast, is a private gallery that must survive on its own, which means it is
                            largely dependent on its relationship with the authorities as well as pressure groups. Bad
                            press may negatively impact the number of visitors, and scandals can affect potential art

                            the interests of the government if they receive state money, similar to how it was in the USSR
                            in Stalin’s time, when government orders were the only way in which artists and the
                            government interacted. Furthermore, since most theaters belong to the state and their budget
                            is subsidized for up to 75% by the government, their repertoire is expected to meet the
                            interests of the government <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            they are willing to subsidize. However, there is no relationship between the criteria by which
                            financial support is provided and the (expected) quality of the work. Rather, content is the

                            Within this context, it becomes more evident why the movie The Death of Stalin by Armando
                            Lannucci was prohibited from being shown in Russia. It satirizes and makes fun of the events
                            surrounding Stalin’s death as well as the ensuing fight for power in the vacuum that was
                            left. The idea that an authority figure, the head of state, can be funny or even absurd is an
                            unacceptable notion among officials. The decision to withdraw The Death of Stalin’s license
                            to be shown was made just two days ahead of its Russian premiere. Members of parliament to
                            whom the film was screened in private claimed to have seen signs of extremism in it, but an
                            official reason as to why it was forbidden was not given <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            All of this is quite confusing. The Death of Stalin’s prohibition was
                            based on value judgments rather than rules or regulations. Evidently, even if there is no
                            applicable law, a committee could theoretically be set up to make such decisions. The
                            minister of culture does not believe in artists’ loyalty toward their country without
                            controlling them. In the aforementioned article of his, he recalls how the creative elite
                            supported the 1917 revolution as well as the 1991 attempt to a Soviet coup d’état, when
                            artists ended up at the center of the forces that destroyed the state <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            Beyond being controlled in what kind of work they produce, artists find themselves under the
                            constant pressure of propaganda. As has been made apparent by now, Russian officials have
                            been going down a similar path as in the USSR. Art that expresses criticism of the status quo
                            and dares to address societal or political flaws is claimed to be trampling traditional values. Such
                            works of art are purportedly organized by Russia’s enemies with the aim of undermining Russian
                            culture by implanting Western values through contemporary art. This train of thought has
                            given birth to the atmosphere of fear and confrontation that now permeates the public
                            discourse on art, whereby you are either on the right side or labeled an enemy of the state. This, once
                            more, is a repetition of phenomena that date back to the USSR — the idea that the world is seeking to
                            destroy a glorious society, so its people must stay united and eliminate internal enemies
                            as ruthlessly as external ones. Concurrently, a campaign for the resurrection of patriotic
                            art that praises the achievements and victories of the past has steadily been gaining
                            traction.

                            Contemporary art is open to interpretation and often cannot be

                            can be recognized all through the 20th century. In times of war, art has consistently been

                            efforts—just like the enemies of the people in the USSR or in the dystopian societies described
                            by George Orwell and Yevgeny Zamyatin. Now, however, the enemies are liberal artists out to
                            supposedly destroy the country from within, impose dubious values, and destroy the moral values of
                            Russian culture. The artist has become an internal enemy against whom aggression can and
                            must be directed. Therefore, to survive in this climate, Russian contemporary artists have little
                            choice but to play by the rules of the new paradigm or risk being ridiculed in the press or
                            attacked by the public while the government and law enforcement turn a blind eye.

                            This chapter addresses my personal struggles and the reasons I self-censor. As stated
                            earlier, discerning self-censorship in the art sphere is complicated by the fact that the
                            decision to do so is made on a personal level; each individual will have their own
                            incentives and disincentives to self-censor or not. In the previous sections the focus was
                            primarily on exploring different layers of the mechanisms of self-censorship in Russia. In
                            addition, they examined the roots of this phenomenon from a historical perspective and in
                            light of more recent events. By engaging with the literature on censorship, exploring
                            developments in the Russian art sphere, and providing a thick description of the synthesis
                            of these, it was possible to approximate how self-censorship works in the country.

                            A different approach to identifying and describing self-censorship is to draw from artists’
                            own statements on the matter, to seek out what their motivations and fears were or still
                            are. Such accounts are unfortunately difficult to obtain. Due to the complex nature of the
                            driving forces behind self-censorship, people will often either prefer not to discuss it or
                            may even consider it to be a positive force that is necessary <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            The reasons to self-censor are wholly dependent on the individual, but it is not possible to
                            peek into other peoples’ internal decision-making process and to fully know their fears or
                            anxieties without them openly talking about this. For this reason, I have taken my personal
                            motivations to self-censor as the foundation to this section. I cannot expect or demand the
                            same degree of candidness on this issue from others as I can from myself. It is their right
                            to talk about what causes them to self-censor to the extent that they are willing to go and
                            be as open as they wish. This study would not be complete without such a personal element.
                            The question at the heart of this chapter and the one I posed other artists as well is: what
                            drives me to censor myself, my work, or the places they are published?

                            It so happened that I was able to observe the current situation in Russia from two
                            perspectives. I am both inside the Russian political system and outside of it. As an artist,
                            I often feel like a person in two worlds: I am a Russian photographer but one who currently
                            resides outside the country, so Russian viewers see me as a person who has left the country
                            and now belongs to the West, whereas Western viewers simply consider me Russian. In effect,
                            I do not belong to either of these worlds, because neither fully counts me as one of their
                            own. Being outside of Russia, I can examine the state of the country, but because I have
                            family there I still self-censor. This is one of the central reasons why I can do a thesis
                            about self-censorship, and at the same time it is why I ask questions about the extent to which I
                            censor myself in my work. I am not under the direct influence of the political system and
                            propaganda of Russia anymore, so I am able to look at these critically. Nevertheless, it is
                            my country, and I feel closely connected to what is taking place there. I read news about
                            Russia in Western sources as well as Russian ones, I am on Russian social media, and my
                            family as well as many of my friends are there. Because of this, I cannot be indifferent to
                            what is taking place in the Russian art world and beyond. It does more than just worry me;
                            it scares me, because I understand that the country is changing and possibly I will not have
                            anywhere to return to, as I may not be able to find a place for myself in that new society.
                            Additionally, nowadays moving abroad does not mean you are cutting your ties to your home
                            country. The Internet gives us the ability to constantly be in touch with people far away,
                            but, at the same time, it also makes escaping the sphere of influence of propaganda and news
                            more difficult.

                            This close connection to Russia, my family, and my cultural background are all part of the
                            foundation of my self-censorship. They have become the reasons why I watch what I say about
                            Russia and where I say it. Over the course of writing this thesis I talked to several
                            artists living in Russia about its subject matter. Each one of them would only speak on
                            condition of anonymity.

                            art world that is interesting but artists’ fight against the political system. Resisting
                            censorship and propaganda while being surrounded by it on a daily basis is immensely tough,
                            however. Very few are able to cope with such pressure, and their numbers have gradually been
                            whittled down. After Pussy Riot's now famous performance and a two-year prison sentence faced by
                            two members of the group, they ceased their performances. They published a recording
                            in which they announced that Pussy Riot was dead would stop their activities <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

This is echoed in the comments on self-censorship given to me by a Russian video

                            against the political system. It is especially dangerous to speak critically of Putin. When
                            creating something particularly radical, you need to be ready for the Russian art world to
                            reject you as it tries to rescue itself. So, if a project’s goal is to impress Western
                            audiences, making a name for yourself there, and leaving the country, it is worth doing. If
                            not, you need to accept the possibility that it might be the last project you make; nobody
                            will want to be associated with you anymore.

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            When trying to define the concept of self-censorship, fear is often identified
                            as a central driving force — fear of the repercussions of your actions, writing,
                            photographs, or paintings. Fear is a relatively broad concept in
                            itself and can encompass a near infinite number of consequences to be afraid of—from
                            something as direct as punitive measures to financial losses, losing esteem, or social
                            isolation. While acknowledging that fear is a common factor, I would argue that there is
                            more nuance and complexity to be found in what provokes self-censorship beyond fear. In my
                            own case, it is a chaotic amalgamation of forces that relate to my family and friends, my
                            cultural background, career uncertainty, and a great many others. Moreover, these factors
                            are often not independent of each other; they intersect and have multiplicative effects,
                            producing a murky torrent of confusion. It is not possible to disentangle them entirely and
                            point to a single overriding factor, because they overlap and are interwoven with aspects of
                            my identity. Together, these become obstacles that may compel me to refrain from engaging in
                            certain projects, abandoning them, avoid discussing them in certain contexts, or limit their
                            publication to specific circles.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            The factors that drive me to self-censor are manifold and differ depending on the subject
                            matter. Nevertheless, there are several that tend to be more prominent influences, which I
                            would like to draw attention to as these provide some insight into how self-censorship need
                            not purely be driven by fear. Firstly, self-censorship can be driven by emotions. As most
                            do, I care deeply about my mother. She is a highly patriotic person, an ardent proponent of
                            Russia, and tends to watch political talk shows a tad too frequently. I know that my work
                            that criticizes Russia would offend her, and I do not want to argue with my mother because
                            of politics. For this reason, I have kept a large portion of my artistic life hidden from
                            her.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            The desire to avoid arguing with her is so simple that it is difficult to even call it
                            self-censorship. Yet, on account of this I will not promote certain projects on social
                            media, because I do not want her to find out about them. Self-censorship does not
                            necessarily need to express itself as refraining from doing a certain project or changing
                            it; limiting the sphere in which you are willing to speak about or promote your work is also
                            way of censoring yourself. I may not personally be influenced by propaganda, but I am
                            affected by it nonetheless due to the effect it has on my family. As a result, I am
                            compelled to watch what I say and where I say it if I want to maintain a peaceful
                            relationship with some of my relatives. Of course, my mother would not disavow me if I would
                            suddenly start discussing politically-heated subjects with her more openly. She is already
                            aware of my political views, but I would know that, in a way, I was hurting her feelings.
                            These kinds of fears play into the government’s hand. What is even more frightening,
                            however, is imagining that by criticizing Russia I could bring harm to my family. When it is
                            possible to go to jail for sharing an image depicting a portrait of Putin being set on fire,
                            it is easy to imagine a wealth of ways you could get youself or your family in trouble <span class="popover_block" data-toggle="popover"

                            Secondly, and in similar vein to the aforementioned, self-censorship can be motivated by
                            friendship. Am I willing to lose some of my friends because of political views and beliefs?
                            Are these beliefs worth that, or is it simpler to just separate art from friendship and
                            avoid discussing sensitive political issues in certain contexts? It is not politeness but
                            self-censorship. This is another form of self-imposed censorship that I am confronted with
                            on a regular basis.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            Thirdly, self-censorship can be prompted by cultural codes. A powerful layer of
                            self-censorship that was etched into my brain—and has remained there to this day—by my
                            Soviet childhood is that criticizing your country means betraying it. When you have grown up
                            under a paternalistic value system in which the state is perceived to take care of you like
                            a father would his children, it becomes quite difficult to address the government’s
                            shortcomings. It is challenging to prove to Russian people that, despite your criticism of
                            it, you still love the country and simply want to make it better. It is far easier to just
                            avoid talking about such subjects altogether, because critical discourse is often resolved
                            rather dichotomously; if you are not on their side you are instinctively seen as an enemy,
                            an instrument of Western interference.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            Finally, self-censorship can be a matter of seeking out success. If I criticize the
                            country’s domestic or foreign politics, question how its history is perceived, or bring up

                            I would be ostracized by most of the art community. Would I be willing to work like
                            Bulgakov did, knowing that I will never become successful or recognized for my efforts
                            and that there is only a slim chance for my work to reach its intended audience in the
                            first place? Unless you have the option of travelling and finding work abroad, it is likely
                            that the practical realities of being a professional artist in Russia will catch up to and
                            overtake your personal ambitions for the country’s future. Even so, the vast majority of the
                            Russian audience will not accept you if live in the West but criticize Russia; you will be
                            considered an enemy for being paid by the West to act against your fatherland. Working with
                            foreign funds is the most common accusation lodged against artists, political opposition, or

                            country’s political system will not make you successful in Russia, which raises a several
                            fundamental questions. If your work is liable to be met by strong pushback from the majority
                            of the population, is it truly worth the price of enduring harsh criticism, insults,
                            threats, or possible criminal persecution? Given Putin’s high approval rate and the
                            difficulty of resisting an endless stream of propaganda, there is no tangible gain to be had

                            even, to concede any dissatisfaction they might harbor toward government policies or the

                            In short, my self-censorship is the product of an inner voice that tells me not to address
                            potentially objectionable topics. If this sounds very broad, that is because it is, indeed,
                            broad. The ever-present possibility of drawing the ire of the government, religious
                            community, conservatives, or any other majority group in the population compels a Russian
                            artist to question their decisions at each and every turn, consider how their work might be
                            perceived or (mis)interpreted, and weigh the risks of publishing provocative content against
                            the reality of exposing oneself to anger, public shaming, social isolation, unemployment,
                            incarceration, assault, or any combination of these. Self-censorship is a voice that
                            whispers to me that my entire family is in Russia; that, even though I am abroad now, I will
                            still have to return there and, by virtue of being a citizen, still need to answer to the
                            government’s whims; that there will be very few who I will be able to show my portfolio to;
                            and that, regardless of my convictions or ambitions, I still need able to afford a roof over
                            my head. As evidenced by the complexity of it all, self-censorship is not black and white. It
                            is multi-layered, a personalized paranoia, and it is difficult to describe yet also easy to
                            let it become second nature and censor yourself unwittingly in order to simply cope. To
                            understand that you’re self-censoring, you need to be honest to yourself first and foremost.

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            Even though I am situated outside the political system of Russia and its direct sphere of
                            influence, I understand that I still censor myself, that I am still afraid of addressing
                            certain topics. The people who live and work in a censored society describe its atmosphere
                            as toxic. They compare it to the rules of a game, that, if they are not
                            followed to the word, prevent you from even beginning to play; you simply need to come to
                            terms with these conditions. You do not really have a choice, because otherwise
                            society will turn its back on you. In private, many people will certainly express
                            dissatisfaction toward the government, but such conversations are confined to the realm of
                            dinner tables or private chats. We get used to thinking that it is better to keep quiet in
                            public, because somebody might be offended or angered. In response to my questions about
                            their experience of self-censorship, one interviewee remarked that she only expresses her
                            political views in private conversations with close friends. In fact, she deliberately never
                            reposts or even comments on negative press about the Russian-Orthodox Church or the
                            government on social media. The reason for this being that she does not want to upset her
                            friends with her political views.

                            The atmosphere of fear and the culture of remaining silent in public is so contagious that even
                            people who express some form of conscious critique in their art may distance themselves from
                            their own work under public pressure. This happened to another person I interviewed, who
                            cited an expression of Boris Nemtsov’s (a liberal politcian who was assassinated in 2015) in his project that roughly translates to Putin is a
                            nutjob. Right after the project’s first public showing at a festival, the artist in question decided to remove
                            the phrase under pressure by the people surrounding him. He explained that he was afraid of
                            being ostracized; he is a part of this society and wishes to continue being a part of it.
                            When it became evident that the audience did not appreciate this gesture in his work, he
                            felt as if his very presence was poisoning the atmosphere around him. People made it clear
                            that problems may arise because of him, that they could lose funding, or be dragged into a
                            public scandal.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph self-censorship">
                            This feeling was intolerable, because this artist wanted to work and be friends with those people; he
                            wanted to continue to live in that country. A single digression — a single unwelcome
                            phrase — could have cost him his career and made him a persona non-grata. Aware of this, he
                            altered his project, even though nobody threatened him to change it. The festival’s
                            organizers simply asked him not to mention the project’s connection to this festival in any
                            of its future displays if he would not change anything, because he was told that would
                            betray them all. For him, the entire situation came as a shock, as he could not have
                            imagined that people who were liberals in private conversions would go to such lengths to
                            avoid potential problems.

                            line with theirs. As if delivering a vaccine to the Russian art world, the government has in the
                            past punished specific artists, marking these as dangers to society. In time, the
                            art community learns to autonomously banish artists who vocally oppose the regime, because

                            surrounding you is afraid, you might think to heed to the concerns of the majority. This is
                            akin to mass paranoia, whereby nobody is quite sure of what is happening or what kind of
                            behavior might elicit punishment. Fears multiply and assume grotesque shapes. It is a

                            the reasoning behind the choice they make will differ from person to person. It can be a
                            matter of coveting success, the desire to avoid social or professional isolation, fear of

                            maintain a stable relationship with one’s family members. Important is that this type of censorship
                            disorients and paralyzes us. We get lost in our doubts. Instead of working, we seek out how
                            to avoid offending anyone or endlessly ruminate on the possible ramifications of our
                            actions. As a result, we do not work at all or at half our capacity, all while anxiously

                            am far away from my home country. To me, it has been a significant leap forward to have
                            simply addressed and organized these thoughts for myself. In discussing them, it is as if I
                            switched on the lights in a room long kept dark and the shadows there have suddenly become
                            less frightening. The simplest way of fighting self-censorship is not to shout from the
                            roofs that society is censoring itself but to begin by being honest with oneself. Figuring out
                            the answer to why you might self-censor can be the first step towards freeing yourself from its grasp, like it was for me.

                            societal standards, or the status quo. In so doing, self-censorship and fear are ingrained
                            deeper and deeper. Someone may be afraid of being cast out from their profession, another
                            may be afraid for their wellbeing, while someone else simply wants to avoid getting
                            themselves or others in trouble. The result of this process in Russia has been that the
                            people in power are criticized mainly in private conservations, rarely in public or in a
                            work of art — a very painful and oppressive silence.

                            came to be treated as instruments that served the authorities’ interests. Their task was not
                            to express their own ideas but to meticulously adhere to the whims of officials. Art needed
                            to instill confidence in the greatness of the country and optimism in its future,
                            glorify the achievements of the government, and be simple enough to be understood by the
                            general public. The foundation for this era’s censorship was repression and artists’ total
                            dependence on the government. This policy achieved its goal, and, for a long time, art in
                            the USSR only had one style: socialist realism.

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            Nowadays, the copious amount of information transferred over the Internet and the demands of
                            modern economies make it infeasible to monitor and control the constant stream of
                            information running through a country. Russian authorities have been unable to resort to the methods of censorship
                            used by Stalin’s officials due to this. Until 2012, authorities did not pay much attention
                            to contemporary artists, but their involvement in several large protests ahead of the 2012
                            presidential elections changed the government’s stance. That year, Pussy Riot also held a
                            performance in Moscow at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in reaction to Putin seeking out
                            a third term as president and the Russian-Orthodox Church’s support for his reelection.
                            Their performance attracted an incredibly harsh reaction from the government and signified
                            an apparent shift in its policy towards art.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            Looking back, 2012 was the beginning of a new form of censorship in Russia. Its goal was not
                            secure total control of the art community but to create a society that, instead, censored
                            itself autonomously. For an artist, self-censorship can range from refusing to worth with certain
                            (controversial) subjects, avoiding publicizing a project that is perhaps already completed,
                            to adapting a project in response to or in anticipation of societal pressure. This
                            phenomenon can be evoked through a multitude of mechanisms, including aggression and intimidation.
                            Officials used Pussy Riot’s
                            performance as a way of legitimizing aggression directed against undesirable artists. They
                            also revised, expanded, and strengthened the law protecting the feelings of the religious
                            community. Since then, this law has been used against many critics of the political or
                            religious establishment.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            It was during this period that the narrative of contemporary artists being opponents of
                            traditional values and the national culture of Russia began to take root. These artists were
                            being portrayed as the internal enemies of the state, which helped to consolidate society
                            around a leader who showed he would protect the country’s and the citizens’ interests.
                            Additionally, pro-Church and pro-government activist groups increasingly took it upon
                            themselves to act as censors of art they perceived as offensive, immoral, or unwelcome.
                            Through their attacks, they succeeded at closing numerous plays, performances, and
                            exhibitions. Yet, these groups’ actions went unpunished, which could be seen as a tacit sign
                            of approval on the part of authorities. On top of this, state-run media harassed artists who
                            publicly spoke out against the government or Church. Tellingly, not everyone who acted out
                            of line was reproached. Rather, a select number were singled out and made an example of.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            The lack of clear-cut laws and the selectivity of punishments seeds uncertainty within the
                            art community. Because people do not understand what is and is not allowed, they set their
                            own far harsher restrictions in trying to safeguard themselves from the possible
                            repercussions of their actions. At the same time, the government encourages adhering to its
                            ideology through financial incentives—a classic carrot-and-stick approach.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            Though seemingly innocuous, the minister of culture’s declaration that the government will
                            only fund art of a very specific nature and content has far-reaching consequences. It
                            highlights that the Russian government is only interested in stimulating and sponsoring art
                            that is in service of its own interests and values. In a country where
                            independently-financed art is few and far between, the effect is that the government has
                            significant leverage over artists and art institutions, and it has a great degree of
                            influence over what kind of art the public is exposed to. These government-approved artists
                            are asked to educate their audience about conservative and patriotic values. In consequence,
                            art in which there is no space for critical views on the country, its history, or its future
                            is being actively stimulated and thus produced. This is evocative of a modernized vision on
                            USSR-era censorship—today’s artists are tasked with goals very similar to those in the
                            socialist realist paradigm under Stalin. The mechanisms employed by the Russian government
                            to further its own objectives — exploiting financial dependencies, the marketization of
                            art, and selectively punishing certain artists on the basis of unclear rules — are indicative
                            of a calculated policy of self-censorship.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            Over time these
                            mechanisms have compelled artists to increasingly self-censor their work and opinions. The
                            response to Serebryakov’s and Raikin’s remarks on the state of Russia and its art world has
                            shown that the art community will denounce critics of the system as a means of self-preservation,
                            even if this means casting out one of their own. As evidenced by the accounts of one of this
                            thesis’ interviewees, this type of behavior is not exclusive to the upper echelons of the
                            art world either—it has permeated the system from top to bottom.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph conclusion">
                            The motivations that drive an artist or any other person to self-censor their work or
                            statements are wholly individual. Its underlying factors can be multi-layered and even
                            confusing to disentangle for the individual themselves, as explored in the final chapter of
                            this thesis. The classic example is, of course, a fear of being punished by authorities, but
                            one's internalized anxieties may extend far wider, too. Perhaps it is the desire to be
                            successful, wanting to be able to work in your home country, or being afraid for your
                            own safety and wellbeing or that of your family — any combination of these or other factors
                            can potentially drive an artist to reconsider publishing an outspoken piece of art or even
                            commenting on sensitive topics. Moreover, each country - not just Russia - has its own
                            subjects that are likely to arouse dissatisfaction among specific subsections of society. While this is not
                            an issue in and of itself, the proliferation and tabooization of such topics should act as
                            societal warning lights. Why are we afraid to talk about such matters? Is it because we are
                            too polite or too afraid? Raising these questions, whether it is in the public discourse or
                            to oneself, will be key to preserving the independence of art and cultural
                            development.
